ToDo for 4.9.23: 
        Check to see if encouragements db on replit is update or not, when user tries to add new message.
        If not figure out why.
ToDO for 4.12.23:
        Try to figure out why delete clause in on message is: 
        a. not deleting records(is it not parsing the index given by the user?(line 86)  

        

        , is the delete_encrouagement function faulty (line 87), something else entirely) 
        and 
        b. returning an empty array.  

-- follow up 12:02PM 4.13.23: 
        1. the statement on line 86 which parses the message given by user to a valid index, works when run in isolation

        2. When I stepped through the code (On Replit) with the debugger the if statement on line 85 
           "if 'encouragments' in db.keys():" seems to resolve to False, bybassing the block of code in said if statement
           lines 86-88 aren't running. So that's a good take away.


ToDo for 4.14.23:
        Try to figure out the meaning of the if statement on line 85 "if 'encouragments' in db.keys():", 
        and why it evaluates to false. 

        Try to get the code block (lines 85-88) to run.
