ToDo for 4.9.23: 
        Check to see if encouragements db on replit is update or not, when user tries to add new message.
        If not figure out why.
ToDO for 4.12.23:
        Try to figure out why delete clause in on message is: 
        a. not deleting records(is it not parsing the index given by the user?(line 86)
        , is the delete_encrouagement function faulty (line 87), something else entirely) 
        and 
        b. returning an empty array.
